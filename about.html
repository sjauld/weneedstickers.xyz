<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  We Need Stickers is the latest incarnation of a group of mates who have been a
  fixture in the local music scene for the past 25 years. Evolving through various
  forms and incarnations, we've now come together in our most exciting iteration
  yet.
</p>

<p>
  Our sound is a lush tapestry woven from the rich tones of guitars, bass, and
  drums, all underpinned by the soulful vibes of the Rhodes and Hammond. This
  unique combination of instruments allows us to craft a mellow yet deeply resonant
  auditory experience, perfect for those who appreciate the subtleties of lo-fi
  and lounge music.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike this biography, we eschew all forms of generative intelligence and allow
  our music to evolve through that pinnacle of human creation, the jam session. We
  invite you to join us on this journey, and let our sounds become the backdrop to
  your most cherished moments.
